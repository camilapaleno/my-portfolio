                "Debbie Lingard is a great director! Unlike some people who say one thing and do another, she leads by example. She is that boss who has no problem getting her hands dirty when necessary. She remains calm and collected at all times and is always there if needed! She also continues to be very open-minded when I suggest my display ideas. Due to her calmness, great personality, and organization, she creates a great environment to work in! And that is definitely something that I can appreciate!"

                "Debbie is the best person to have on your team. She has great ideas and execution skills and is a great leader or team member. She has a high level of ability and no ego, so she is very easy to work for, with, or around. She can handle more on her own than most people with entire teams working for them. She is also a great caterer and makes delicious food for parties or events. Overall, Debbie is a diamond in the rough."

                "I cannot say enough wonderful things about Lingard Events! Debbie Lingard has catered multiple events for me both large and small - all were memorable and exceptional thanks to Debbie, who personally meets with me, asks what I have in mind for the event, and immediately understands what I want.  The day of the event she shows up, works fast, and efficiently and like magic, the entire party is set up. The food is always fresh and delicious and her set up is an artful display of  mouthwatering and beautiful food. Debbie works hard and is highly professional and committed to making her clients happy. Her team is talented and move about seamlessly tending to guests, making sure glasses are filled, appetizers passed and clean up is spotless. She makes all of our parties a huge success - everyone is always impressed. I have Debbie on speed dial for my next event. Thank you Debbie!"

                "Debbie Lingard did an outstanding job catering our wedding! She took the time to "see" what we wanted in terms of food, the layout, most importantly THE CAKE... and, of course, things I didn't even begin to think about; and she very professionally and beautifully pulled it all together; seemingly effortlessly! The guests were attended to in a comfortable manner. I received many compliments on how wonderful the reception was.... and really, Debbie deserved all the praise!!!  I was relaxed and truly able to enjoy my special day!"

                “After I attended a couple of Lingard events, Debbie was the first person I thought of when planning several family get-togethers.  Her food is consistently tasty and fresh, and the variety has been enjoyed by all. And she has excellent pricing and service”.
