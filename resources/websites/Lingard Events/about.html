            <h2>Meet the Owner:</h2>
            <p><br><br>     A native of Southern California and a graduate of California State University, Northridge, Debbie Lingard began her food and beverage journey at the age of 17 in a small French bakery. In the seven years that she worked there, she taught herself everything she could about the operations of the bakery and played an instrumental part in its expansion into a full service café. 
                <br><br> <img src="./resources/img/profile.png" style="width:150px; float: right; padding: 10px">
                Moving on to the Hyatt Regency Maui,  she held two management positions and played a key role in the renovation and re-opening of the hotel’s family restaurant. Returning to Los Angeles, she continued her hotel career at the Hyatt Wilshire, holding simultaneous positions as banquet and beverage manager. 
                <br><br>
                As client liaison for a gourmet picnic company, Debbie provided superior service, created menus and learned the ins and outs of planning large events and as a member of the opening management team at the Long Beach Aquarium, she took on the dual role of sous chef and front of house manager.
                <br><br>
                ​Debbie has also held the position of catering director at three high volume Los Angeles restaurants and has planned over 300 weddings. Prior to Covid-19, she was kept quite busy as the event planner and caterer for her church community. Debbie’s passion for her business and commitment to her clients is evidenced by her hands-on approach and the way that she works closely with each client to create a unique and memorable event.</p>
